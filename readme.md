# TaskTracker++

Task tracker is the todo list app that I have always wanted. I wanted it to be simple enough that it didn't get in the way of getting stuff done. But I wanted some more advanced features that most task apps are lacking. 

This includes a timer to help keep focus and statistical tracking to see how much time you dedicated to each task. See stats of what you worked on and how long tasks and projects take you.


### TODO:
+ Build out task creation functionality
+ Build out timer window
+ Build out stats tracking functionality


### Potential Future Features
+ Ability to categorize tasks into groups (epics) that will will provide statistical summary of tasks contained within.
+ Graphs and other Visualizations that can provide interesting insights where your time is spent.
+ Ability to log-in and store data in the cloud.
+ Configurable Settings
+ ect...


### Bug List
+ Fix Multi Touch Task repositioning.
+ Make sure that swappling lists is multi-touch protected.
