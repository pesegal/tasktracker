# TaskTracker++
######version: 0.1-beta
## Description

TaskTracker is the todo list app that I have always wanted. Instead of focusing on deadlines and reminders the whole
app is focused on improving ones focus and flow. Organize your tasks on what you need to work on today. Didn't finish 
something? Throw it into the tomorrow list or future list. Color code and organize your tasks by project.

Select a task to work and start the timer. Using the pomodoro style timer to track focus. Once you have built up enough
work history you can use the interactive stats screen to look for insights and patterns into you work style and focus.
Need more advanced analytics? Extract your work history into a .csv file and have at it!

Note this was a learning project for me so expect rough edges here and there. 

### Operational Tips
Click and hold on a task to drag from list to list. Right click and hold to open up a quick menu.

All data is automatically real time. You can create and load backups in the settings menu.
