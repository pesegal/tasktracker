# TaskTracker++

Task tracker is the todo list app that I have always wanted. I wanted it to be simple enough that it didn't get in the way of getting stuff done. But I wanted some more advanced features that most task apps are lacking. 

This includes a timer to help keep focus and statistical tracking to see how much time you dedicated to each task. See stats of what you worked on and how long tasks and projects take you.
